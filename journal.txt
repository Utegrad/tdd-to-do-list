installed a jenkins agent server to run functional tests from.  Unit tests couldn't be run on PET110 because the system
    sqlite install is too old.  Running the tests on a newer box is much easier.  Deployment still to PET110 from
    new agent box.  Should have a decent CI/CD chain for further work.  # TODO clean out scripts not used during CI/CD?
    Need to get back to Django tutorial.
